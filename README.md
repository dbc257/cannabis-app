## :herb: Cannabis Strain app :herb:

**Purpose of this app:**

As cannabis laws are changing, its medical use and recreational use are increasing in states where it is legal. Hence, this application's main purpose is to allow the recreational and/or medical cannabis user to sort through the numerous different cannabis strains available today. It's secondary purpose is to educate people about the different strain types, strain flavors, and strain effects so that newcomers are able to make an informed decision when buying cannabis legally. Cannabis strains can be viewed by name, type, flavor, positive effects, negative affects, and medical conditions. This application utilizes The Strain API (http://strains.evanbusse.com/?ref=public-apis).

**How to use:**

Anyone can access the website. Simply, go to https://cannabis-app.netlify.app/. A user does not need to enter any credentials to access the application. One can access the different pages of the website by either clicking on the navigation bar or by clicking on the cards below the image carousel on the home page. If the user clicks on any of the carousel images, the website opens up a new window to an informational article related to the image's caption.

**Features on the app:**

Upon entering the home page of the website, the image carousel is most likely the first thing that the user notices. As described above, the user can click on any carousel image to have the website open another tab to an educational article. The Navigation Bar is located above the image carousel on the Home Page. If the user clicks on the "Cannabis Strain App" link, it will take the user to the Home Page. If the user clicks on the "View" link, the Navigation Bar displays a dropdown list of Navigation Links such as "Strain Types", "Strain Effect", "Strain Flavors", and "All Strains." To the right of the "View" link, the user will see the "About Us" link. The Navigation Bar and the image carousel was created with Bootstrap 4. Underneath the image carousel, the user will see cards. The top card that is titled "Why Cannabis" explains why the group decided to choose this particular project. The rest of the cards have titles that include "Cannabis Strain Effects", "Cannabis Strain Types", "Cannabis Strain Flavors", and "All Cannabis Strains". If the user clicks on any of these cards, the website will go to the same links that are on the Navigation Bar's "View" dropdown. The Navigation Bar is replicated on each page of the website for uniformity and ease of use. If the user navigates to the Strain Types Page, they will see three buttons that allow them to filter through the cannabis strains by either "Sativa", "Hydrid", or "Indica". After that, the user can navigate to the Strain Effects Page where they will see three selector tools. The selector tools allow the user to filter through the cannabis strains by either positive effects, medical conditions, or negative side affects. Then, the user may navigate to the Strain Flavors Page where the user may click on the selector tool with all the strain flavors. Next, the All Strains Page allows the user to click on the "View All Strains" button or to search for cannabis strains by name. If the user clicks the "View All Strains" button, the page will display all 2,162 cannabis strains listed on the The Strain API's database. Finally, the user may navigate to the About Us Page which has pictures, descriptions, and LinkedIn Buttons for each group member that helped to create this wonderful application.
